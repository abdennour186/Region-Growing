# Region Growing Algorithm

## Description
This project implements a Region Growing algorithm in Python for image segmentation. The algorithm segments an image by grouping neighboring pixels with similar attributes into regions.

## Features
- **Region Growing**: Segments an image based on pixel similarity.
- **Seed Point Initialization**: Allows the user to specify starting points for segmentation.
- **Thresholding**: Defines the similarity criteria for including neighboring pixels in a region.
